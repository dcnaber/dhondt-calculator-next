# D'hondt Calulator

## What is D'hondt Calculator?

The D'Hondt calculator is a tool used to allocate seats in proportional representation systems based on the D'Hondt method. The D'Hondt method is a mathematical formula used to calculate the distribution of seats in a party-list proportional representation system.

The D'Hondt method works by dividing the total number of votes each party receives by a series of divisors that increase incrementally, starting from 1, until all the seats have been allocated. The party with the highest quotient (the result of dividing the party's total votes by the divisor) gets the first seat, and this process is repeated until all seats are allocated.

The D'Hondt calculator automates this calculation process and allows for easy and accurate allocation of seats based on the D'Hondt method. It is commonly used in elections, especially in countries with proportional representation systems.
